Welcome Message:
---------------
The home branch starts with a simple, user-friendly interface that displays a welcome message: "Welcome to Employee Wage Computation Program".
This message serves as the entry point for users, making it clear what the application is about.
Basic Design:

The page is styled with a modern design, featuring a clean layout with an attractive background and a welcoming color scheme. This ensures the user has a pleasant experience right from the start.
Key elements such as the welcome message are emphasized with visually appealing text styles and a background color.
Initial Structure:

At this stage, no complex functionality is included. It focuses purely on introducing the project and setting the groundwork for the upcoming use cases.
All future features and computations will be built on top of this foundation, making it the main starting point for the entire project.
